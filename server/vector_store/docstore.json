Skill\nNingguang's Elemental Skill has a 6 second \ninternal cooldown on generating energy, so \nfor the sake of maintaining Elemental Burst \nuptime, wait 6 seconds to cast again if you \nneed energy. It also breaks when casted on \ntop of another Geo Structure, you can \nintentionally use a structure to break your \nfirst screen.\n\n\n\nNOTES\nDPS\nAssumes buffs from Bennett and 40% Geo DMG Bonus.\n\nRegarding Weapon Choices:\nMemory of Dust: This weapon performs slightly worse if Ningguang does not have a shielder or consistent Crystallize uptime.\nThe Widsith / Solar Pearl: These weapons perform better than Skyward Atlas at [R5].\nFlowing Purity: This weapon performs worse than Dodoco Tales if you cannot clear the Bond of Life from its passive.\n\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nNighttime Whispers in the Echoing Woods (4): This ranking assumes Ningguang consistently has a crystallize shield.\nEmblem of Severed Fate (2): This set performs worse than other options when Ningguang does not need to build Energy Recharge%.\nHusk of Opulent Dreams (4): This set performs on par with Archaic Petra (2) +18% ATK set (2) with its inclusion in the strongbox it has become a strong generalist option.\nThundersoother (4) / Lavawalker (4): These two sets are Ningguang's second best sets in teams where Electro or Pyro Auras exist on enemies for the entire rotation.","metadata":{}}]]
